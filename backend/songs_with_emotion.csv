Ariana Grande,Feminism (Quotes),when will people stop being offended by women showing skin  expressing sexuality men take their shirts off  express their sexuality onstage in videos on instagram anywhere they want to all the time the double standard is so boring and exhausting with all due respect i think it's time you get your head out of your ass sic women can love their bodies too  responding to a commenter who said she was like a whore in her dangerous woman video on facebook  the incredible double standard that we women face on a daily basis in the industry and just in the world it's shocking i would be so amused and pardon me if this comes across as sexist but i don't think a male artist would be in this position right now sorry if i'm speaking about something that i'm passionate about i'm willing to take the brunt for fighting in what i believe in and my fellow women are definitely something that i will always be one of the first to speak up about  is this what you think girls have trouble choosing between  is this men assuming that that's what girls would have to choose between  you need a little brushing up on equality over here  i have a long list of things i'd like to change  i think judgement in general intolerance meanness double standards misogyny racism sexism you know all that shit there's lots we've got to get started on that's what we need to focus on we've got work to do  responding to the question if you could use makeup or your phone one last time what would you pick on california's power 06 fm  i'm tired of needing to be linked to a guy i'm not big sean's ex i'm not niall's new possible girl i'm ariana grande  to the sun  what i meant when i said what i said about not being sean's ex is that i am tired of living in world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past present or future property  possession i  do not belong to anyone but myself and neither do you  i can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating married attached to having sex with or not seen with  but by their value as an individual   people are so ignorant sometimes stop trying to make people feel badly about their bodies it's okay to be different  to be curvy or to be thin when did it become socially acceptable to comment on what you think is 'wrong' with other people's bodies we were having fun dancing on stage 'what's she shaking tho' i'm shaking my pretty cute petite ass next to nicki's pretty big booty both are fing awesome how about we respect people's body boundaries and encourage each other to feel like a babe no matter how they are that would be nice so tired of watching everyone try to tear each other down  on instagram  gloria steinem published an article in 969 titled 'after black power women's liberation' and 46 years later  we're still not quite there yet if a woman has lots of sex or any sex for that matter  she's a 'slut' if a man has sex  he's a stud a bossssss a king if a woman even talks about sex openly  she is shamed but if a man talks or raps freely about all the women or more commonly used 'bitches'hoes'  how lovely he's had  he is regaled if a woman is seen with a friend with a penis there is immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled if a man is seen with a woman his status is elevatedcelebrated  on twitter,anger

Ariana Grande,Focus (Meaning),the first line of 'focus' is 'i know what i came to do and that ain't gonna change' what i came here to do in this world is not only to entertain but to love to share to listen to improve to learn to share music to share experience to share feelings to make people feel happy and empowered she explained  to make people feel like they're not alone without using my voice to do those things i would feel empty she continued when i say 'focus on me' i'm not asking to be the center of attention i'm not asking you to focus on my face or my clothes or my body or my singing voice by 'focus on me' i literally mean focus on me focus on what i'm all about and what i believe in  the more we focus on each other as people and not on what we look like what we're wearing our gender our hairstyle our sexuality the color of our skin but focus on each other on a soul level the more we realize how much we have in common the more we listen to each other the more one we become  the title of ari's track might seem like an effort to get people to focus on the right things about her too since she's had such a tumultuous year ahem remember the donut incident but she insists this is about all of us  you judge because you don't focus on me you don't focus on each other she explained you judge because you focus on appearance on clothes you focus on what you want from me what you want from people how you want them to wear their hair you judge me you wanna see me dressed a certain way how you wanna see their makeup their eyebrows you focus on what you think people should be like for you but when you stop and you actually focus on someone you'll see the light in them when you focus on me you see the light in me when we focus on each other we see the light in each other and even if you don't this is who we are what are we making fun of what's there to make fun of we should apologize for that,joy

Ariana Grande,Open Letter to Fans,so the news is out about sam  cat i felt it wasnt my place to make any sort of announcement so i kept quiet until now i want to thank nickelodeon for making a childhood dream of mine come true for being a family to me for being so accommodating and supportive of my multitasking with my music career and for of course ducing me to many of my fans however many years ago i want to thank dan schneider for allowing me to play such a special beautiful character who i hid behind for so long what i mean by that is when i was younger people loved cat so much i used to pretend to be more like her it took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are i think thats honestly because i admire her so much her appreciation for life and everybody she encounters her passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread like school projects and work she always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good  i will always hold cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult i know she seems like a simple daft character and she is but she played such a huge part in my life i just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things i love most about her i think a lot of people could take a page out of her book she wouldnt judge anybody by their appearance she believed the best in people she wasnt afraid of anything or anybody she never let peoples judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted acting how she wanted dressing how she wanted wanted dying her hair however she wanted she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real which is something i personally do all the time but i wish i could shake that and celebrate every little thing like she does  one of my favorite things about cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder as we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across we hold back a little more protect ourselves a little more and although cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up she never changed or lost her childlike wonder to me thats the bravest most special thing about her she actually reminds me a lot of frankie in that way  so i know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some dumb kids show character     but to me she is actually a lot smarter stronger and braver than all the rest of us  hopefully well find out one day if cat  robbie ever got married if i had any say in the story from here on out id make sure they were happily married with sweet eccentric jewish artificially red headed babies cat would constantly find herself reminding aunt sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house theyd live down the street from jade and beck also happily married with purple and black haired pale grungy beautiful goth babies   thank you to the cast and crew who i spent almost every day with for a good 4 or 5 years thanks for lighting us beautifully shooting us beautifully making the most incredible props yelling at us when we were running late to set keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment the guys behind the scenes couldnt have been more pleasant or hard working and i appreciate them for that so much i cant imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in hollywood  thank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine dan schneider i will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted  lastly thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started you are the most loyal dedicated and continuously loving supporters i could ever imagine weve been through so much and you are still here and weve got a long way to go  thank you for believing in me accepting me and loving me i love you forever,love

Ariana Grande,Open Letter Critiquing Sexism,being empowered is not the same as being a bitch having something to say is not the same as having a bad attitude  what i meant when i said what i said about not being sean's ex is that i am tired of living in a world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past present or future property  possession i do not belong to anyone but myself and neither do you i have clearly not been having the boy questions in my interviews lately because i have come to the realization that i have so much more to talk about i'm currently making the best music i've ever made in my life having the best time of my life on tour with some of the greatest people i've ever known working my ass off every single day performing  creating for my babes and getting the chance to meet and hug my babes all over the world every day  i come from a long bloodline of female activists my aunt judy was the first italian american female president of the national press club in washington dc i think she would have been proud of me for speaking up about something that has been bothering me personally for so long gloria steinem published an article in 969 titled after black power women's liberation and 46 years later we're still not quite there yet if a women has a lot of sex or any sex for that matter she's a slut if a man has sex he's a stud a bossssss a king if a woman even talks about sex openly she is shamed but if a man talks or raps freely about all the women or more commonly used bitcheshoes how lovely he's had he is regaled if a woman is seen with a friend with a penis there is an immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled if a man is seen with a woman his status is elevated  celebrated aww shiiit he smashed  i know y'all already know this but the double standard and misogyny are still ever present i can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating  married to  attached to having sex with or not  seen with but by their value as an individual  i want the people reading this to know that they are more than enough on their own i want the media to please help me with this please support each other i'm saying this after literally 8 years of feeling like i constantly had to have a boy by my side after being on my own now for a few months i am realizing that that's just not the case i have never felt more present grounded and satisfied i've never laughed harder or had more fun or enjoyed my life more  one more thought my honeymoon diaries are my way of sharing absolutely as much as i can with my fans that is something i have done since day one and never plan on changing it is a safe environment for me to be myself and share funny special personal things with my fans and to laugh about silly things i've done  things i'm going through i don't plan on monitoring or changing that because there are more eyes on me now than there were before i love y'all with all my heart you've accepted and celebrated me not only as an artist but as a person since day one and and nothing will change that or change me  any woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke she will need her sisterhood  gloria steinem,sadness

Beyoncé,Yours And Mine,narration beyoncé  i sometimes wish i could just be anonymous and walk down the street just like everyone else before i was famous i was the girl on the heel with the  i was the girl who just wanted a beautiful view of the beach and now that i'm famous it's really really difficult to do very simple things i think it's the hardest thing to give up but my mother always taught me to be strong and to never be a victim never make excuses never expect anyone else to provide for me things i know i can provide for myself i have dreams and i feel like i have a power to actually make those dreams a reality when you're famous no one looks at you as a human anymore you become the property of the public there's nothing real about it  just look at these dazzling women the finest representatives of our nation ready to reach for the stars and grab the crown  you can't put your finger on who i am i can't put my finger on who i am i am complicated i grew up with a lot of conflict and drama's and i've been through a lot just like everyone else my escape was always music and i'm so lucky that that's my job but if i accomplished all of these things and had no one to share with it would be worth nothing you know you need something real in order for any of this stuff to matter you have to have something that is forever something that's invisible  i was brought up seeing my mother try to please and make everyone comfortable and i always felt like it was my job to fix the problem people pleaser but i'm no longer afraid of conflict and i don't think conflict is a bad thing because i know that when you grow up when you learn a few things  you're no longer afraid of letting go you're no longer afraid of the unknown you're no longer afraid of going to certain places in your body and your mind and your soul that may make you feel uncomfortable and it all starts with if you could look at yourself in the mirror and say i like that person you know if i hadn't gone through you know some of the painful experiences in my life i would not be me and i feel like my body is borrowed and this life is very temporary i watched my friends body deteriorate and to see some one pass on so gracefully put everything into perspective we do not value ourselves enough especially young people don't really appreciate how brilliant our bodies are i've always been very very specific and very choosy very choosy about what i do with my body and who i want to share that with people feel like they lose something when they get married but it doesn't have to be that way there's nothing more exciting than having a witness to your life i always considered myself a feminist although i was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it when honestly it's very simple it's just when you know a person that believes in equality for men and women men and women balance each other out and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with appreciating each other i have a lot of empathy for men and the pressures that they go through and the cultures that have been created especially for africanamerican men i have the same empathy for women and the pressures we go through the woman has to provide so many things for their children i consider myself a humanist  you know everybody's not good at everything you know it's ok to depend on someone it's actually what we're supposed to do we're supposed to depend on each other and when you find the person that you trust and you love and you feel is going to respect you and take all of the shit you have and turn it around and bring out the best in you and feed you it is the most powerful thing you can feel in your life happiness comes from you no one else can make you happy you make you happy and one thing that's for sure the love i have for music for my husband for my child is something that will last far beyond my life,joy

Beyoncé,Gender Equality is a Myth!,we need to stop buying into the myth about gender equality it isnt a reality yet today women make up half of the us workforce but the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes but unless women and men both say this is unacceptable things will not change men have to demand that their wives daughters mothers and sisters earn more commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect  humanity requires both men and women and we are equally important and need one another so why are we viewed as less than equal these old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning we have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect so that as they grow up gender equality becomes a natural way of life and we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible  we have a lot of work to do but we can get there if we work together women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters we must demand that we all receive 00 percent of the opportunities,anger

Beyoncé,“Self-Titled” Part 2 . Imperfection,there's a moment where things click when i was in the studio i was threading the songs together and ithought of this performance which was a really defining moment in my life as a child in my mind we would perform on star search we would win we would get a record deal and that was my dream at the time there's no way in the world i would ever imagine losing as a possbility you know i was only 9 years old so at that time you don't realise that you could actually work super hard and give everything you have and lose it was the best message for me when i put ed macmahon ducing us as the hiphop rapping girls' tyme it clicked something in my mind i feel like something about the aggression of bow down and the attitude of flawless  the reality is sometimes you lose and you're never too good to lose you're never too big to lose you're never too smart to lose it happens and it happens when it needs to happen and you have to embrace those things    i was scrolling through videos about feminism on youtube and i ran across this video of this incredible nigerian author chimamanda ngozi adichie everything she said is exactly how i feel  my message behind this album is finding the beauty in imperfection i had this image of this trophy and me accepting these awards and kind of training myself to be this champion and at the end of the day when you go through all of these things is it worth it i mean you get this trophy and you're like 'i basically starved i have neglected all of the people that i love i've conformed to what everybody else thinks i should be and i have this trophy what does that mean' the trophy represents all of the sacrafices i made as a kid all of the time that i lost being on the road in the studios as a child and i just wanna throw that shit up i have a lot of awards and i have a lot of these things that i'm amazing and i'm  i worked my ass of i worked harder then probably everybody i know to get those things but nothing feels like my child saying 'mommy' no nothing feels like when i look at my husband in the eyes nothing feels like when i'm respected when i get on the stage and i see i'm changing people's lives those are the things that matter and at this point in my life that's what i'm striving for growth love happiness fun enjoying your life it's short  that's the message,joy

Beyoncé,“Self-Titled” Part 1 . The Visual Album,i see music it's more than justwhat i hear when i'm connected to something i immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or emotion a memory from my childhood thoughts about life my dreams or my fantasies and they're all connected to the music and i think that's one of the reasons why i wanted to do a visual album i wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head cause it's what makes it mine that vision in my brain is what i want people to experience the first time    i feel like right now people experience music differently i remember seeing thriller on tv with my family it was an event we all sat around the tv and now looking back i'm so lucky i was born around that time i miss thatimmersive experience now people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their ipods  they don't really invest in a full album it's all about the single and the hype there's so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans i felt like 'i don't want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out i just want this to come out when it's ready and from me to my fans' i told my team 'i wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time' everyone thought i was crazy but we're actually doing it it's happening    i wanted to make this body of work and i feel like it's something that's lost in pop music i wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album it was important that we made this a movie we made this an experience i wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me i would make my best art and just put it out and that'sthat's why it's out today,joy

Billie Eilish,Paparazzi Instagram Monologue,so i just wanted to say something real quick which is yesterday i was at kimmel which was amazing and when i left i had to go to a rehearsal so to walk to the car there was an alley that i walked through like 500 feet to my left was a group of fans and then like 500 feet to my right was what i thought was fans and paparazzi  i started i went to the left side i walked all the way over to them and hugged them all i took pictures and talked to them for a second didn't sign anything because i like don't do that that's something i don't do because i used to and i realised all anyone did was sell everything that i signed so i stopped doing that it's kind of a policy of mine that i don't  so i talked to them hugged them all i went to the other side and as i got closer like they were cheering for me and stuff and shouting for my name and stuff and so i walked  and as i got closer i kind of realised that it was pretty much all paparazzi and ebayers which is what we call people that just take my signature and sell it and couldn't give less of a fuck about me at all  but i didn't want to like be disrespectful at all so i went up to them all and i like tried to get like hugs and try to touch all of their hands like do that down the line or whatever and i started to do that nobody put their hands out nobody tried to hug me backi hugged one girl at the end and so she was really sweet  but then i tried to walk like a couple feet across from where they were not where the first group was but like in the same area that i was in because i thought that's where there were fans  when i looked over there they were gone and i was like ok well i guess nobody here really wants anything from me besides a fucking autograph which i don't do because these bitches will sell that shit  like i'll sign something if it's like for a special occasion or if somebody's in need or whatever of course i'm gonna do that but i have this whole thing about not signing things because i just want to be there i'd way rather get a hug and talk to you than take a picture with you and fucking sign something so you can sell that shit  i don't do that and i've tried to make that clear like a billion times  and i said it before i went over to them  anyway  i started to walk away because i realised none of these people actually cared about anything that had to do with me as a person um and so i walked away  as i started to walk away back to the car they all started to boo me  and then they all started calling me a little bitch and saying i'm gonna lose my grammy nominations and you know what a little fucking you know whatever just cursing me out and shit  damn dude like  then i started hearing them comparing they kept being like lorde would have stopped i'm like i did stop i walked 500 fe i walked like 000 feet to come say hi to you and give some hugs and y'all are booing me and calling me a little bitch  like the fact that people can switch up like that clicks fingersdamn like wait outside for you and then immediately they don't get what they want and they boo you and fucking curse at you  i'm like bro i'm 7 you're  oh my god this shit isexasperated whoo i turned around ready to fucking pounce and then i got told to just ignore it and not give a reaction which is probably good and it's probably stupid dumb of me making these videos but  mmanyway the only reason i'm making this video is because i saw a video of this all happening and i just wanted to clarify what actually happened because if you watch the video it literally looks like i'm watching by a bunch of fans and like completely ignoring them and not saying hi to them which is not at all what happened  i literally walked from the other side of the alley which was like 000 feet which is fine i'm like happy to do it but i walked over there literally only to say hi only to hug people i literally went over and i was like i don't want pictures i want to hug and i got pictures of me shoved into my fucking face and no love whatsoever  so i left and then i got booed and got called a little bitch and got told that i'm gonna lose my grammys  i probably am gonna lose the grammys but it's okay though i'm not worried about that it's the nomination that counts  anyway i don't know i just wanted to i don't even knowi went back to the other side where the real fans were and i was like guys they booed me and they were very sweet you guys are my friends i love you a lot  and to the grown men that booed me and called me a little bitch i hope the best for you i hope you can find someone else you can use to make money off of and belittle so yeah all the best  love you paparazzi,joy

BTS (방탄소년단),Love Yourself: 轉 Tear Notes,seokjin 0 august year   can anyone remember the moment they fall in love can anyone predict the moment their love will end what could be the reason that humans dont have the ability to recognize those moments and why was i given the power to return all of those things  the car came to a sudden stop the headlights flash crashing bouncing falling i did nothing but stand defenseless in the face of all of those moments i heard no sound and felt no sensations it was summer but the wind seemed cold there was the sound of something tumbling along the street then there was the scent of flowers only then did a sense of reality come to me the bouquet of smeraldo flowers fell from my hand she was laying there in the middle of the street there was blood flowing in between the strands of her hair the dark red blood flowers along the street i thought if only i could turn back time  seokjin  july year 0  past the school doors the sound of cicadas prickled my ears the school yard was crowded with kids laughing and playing and competing in races it was the start of summer vacation and everyone was chattering i ducked my head and walked in between them i wanted to leave as quickly as i could  hyung i lifted my head surprised by the sudden appearance of someones shoulder it was hoseok and jimin they looked at me their smiles as wide and bright as ever and their eyes full of mischief today is the start of vacation are you still going to leave hoseok asked tugging at my arm i muttered sure and a few more meaningless words then turned my head away what had happened that day was clearly an accident it wasnt intentional i hadnt imagined that jungkook and yoongi would be in the storage room at that time the principal suspected that i was covering for my dangsaengs i had to say something but in the end yoongi had gotten expelled nobody knew that i had been the complicit  have a good vacation hyung ill call you maybe having interpreted my expression hoseok let his hand drop slightly and forced an even brighter greeting i couldnt answer this time either there was nothing i could say as i passed the school gate i thought of the first day i had come to this school we had all been punished  for tardiness together we could laugh because of it i had ruined these moments  yoongi 5 june year   i wasn't aware of anything other than the sound of music playing in my head not how much i had drunk nor where i was nor what i had been doing i didnt know and it wasnt important when i went outside stumbling it was already night i swayed as i walked i bumped into pedestrians news kiosks walls i didnt care i just wanted to forget everything  jimins voice was still ringing in my ears hyung jungkook my next memory was of running like crazy up the hospital steps the hospital hall had been strangely long and dark i passed people wearing hospital gowns my heart pounded everyones faces were too pale they had no expressions they all seemed like dead people the sound of my breathing was harsh inside my own head  inside the slightly opened hospital room door jungkook was lying there i turned my head without realizing it i couldnt look at him at that moment i suddenly heard the sound of a piano of flames of a building crumbling down i clutched my head and sank down this is your fault if it wasnt for you it was my mothers voice no my voice no someones voice at those words i was tormented by countless moments i wanted to believe it wasnt so but jungkook was lying there jungkook was lying in a hall full of corpse like patients passing by i was utterly unable to go inside i couldnt check for myself when i stood my legs threatened to give out i left with tears flowing it was funny i couldnt even remember the last time i had cried  i went to cross the street but someone grabbed my arm and i came to a halt who was it no i didnt care no matter who it was it was all the same dont come near me go away just leave me be i dont want to hurt you either i dont want to be hurt so please dont come any closer  yoongi  june year 9  i thoughtlessly ditched school but truthfully i didnt have anywhere to go it was hot i had no money and i had nothing to do it was namjoon who said we should go to the beach the younger kids seemed excited but i didnt particularly feel like it nor did i dislike the idea do we have money at my question namjoon made everyone shake out their pockets a few coins a few bills so we cant go the one who said we could just walk was probably taehyung namjoon made a face begging them to reconsider but the kids just chattered away laughing and pretending to roll around on the road before starting to walk i wasnt in the mood to talk back so i just fell behind it was midday so even the gingko trees couldnt provide shade and the cars kicked up dust as they passed us on the sidewalkless road  lets go there it was taehyung this time too or was it hoseok i didnt care so i didnt look carefully but it would have been one of them i had been walking along with my head down kicking dirt when i almost collided with someone i lifted my head jimin was standing there as if frozen in place the muscles in his face trembled as if had seen something terrifying he was staring at a sign that said flowering arboretum  kilometers  i didnt want to walk i heard jungkooks voice sweat dripped from jimins face he went pale as if he might collapse at any second what is it i had a strange feeling park jimin i called but as i expected he didnt budge i lifted my head again and looked at the sign  hey its so hot why would we go to an arboretum lets go to the beach i said as if dragging my feet i didnt know what kind of place the arboretum was but it didnt seem like we should go whatever the reason jimins expression was strange we dont even have money hoseok replied thats why were walking and taehyung added if we just walk to the train station we can probably make it then namjoons said instead well just starve at dinner jungkook and taehyung pretended to cry and seokjin hyung laughed jimin only started to move again once it was decided that we would take the road toward the train station walking with his head down and his shoulders trembling jimin seemed like a small child i looked up at the sign again the characters spelling flowering arboretum were gradually getting further away  namjoon  july year   i rested my head against the bus window from the library to the gas station the scenery passed by the window almost frighteningly familiar since i took this route everyday would there come a day i could leave this scenery behind i felt that it was impossible to predict what tomorrow would bring nor to hope for anything  there was a woman sitting in front of me her hair tied with a yellow rubber band her shoulders lifted and then dropped as if she was sighing then she rested her head against the window for around a month already we had studied at the same library and gotten on the bus at the same stop we hadnt spoken a word to each other but we looked at the same scenery and lived on the same time and sighed the same sighs the hair tie was still in my pants pocket  the woman always got off the bus three stops before i did every time i saw her leave i wondered if she was going to distribute fliers what kind of time was she spending what kind of things was she enduring how strongly did she feel stifled at the thought that tomorrow might not come or that from the beginning there had never been such a thing as tomorrow i thought things like that  the womans stop began to approach someone pressed the stop request button and other passengers stood up from their seats but in the midst of this that woman didnt stir she just stayed in her seat her head against the window it seemed like she was asleep should i go and wake her i fought with myself for a moment the bus approached the stop the woman didnt move people disembarked the door closed and the bus started to move  the woman didnt wake even as we passed the next three stops as i moved to the bus door i fought with myself again it was clear that once i got off the bus no one else would pay attention to her she would wake up somewhere far from her stop and it was impossible to know how much more tired she would be today because of it  i left the bus stop and started to walk toward the gas station the bus took off and i didnt look back i had left the hair tie on top of her bag but that was it that wasnt a beginning and as such nor was it an end it was nothing to start with and there was no reason for it to be anything so i thought it really didnt matter  namjoon 7 december year   the people waiting for the bus rubbed their hands together in the cold i looked down at the dirt clutching the strap of my bag i was trying to not make eye contact with anyone it was a countryside village where only two buses stopped per day from a distance i saw the first bus approaching  i boarded the bus behind everyone else i didnt look back when i was passionate about something when i barely had something in my grasp when i had nothing left but things to escape i had conditions i wasnt to look back the moment i looked back the efforts id made until now became little more than seafoam looking back that was a kind of suspicion a kind of lingering attachment and a kind of fear only when i had overcome these things could i finally escape  the bus started off i had no plans i had nothing i was passionate about nothing in my group no particular reason to escape it was closer to thoughtlessly running away from my mothers tired face my wandering sibling my fathers illness starting with the situation in our house that grew more difficult with every passing day from my family who enforced sacrifice and tranquility and from me who pretended to know nothing and restrained myself from trying to adjust and grow resigned but most of all it was closer to running from poverty  if anyone asked if its a crime to be poor everyone would say its not but is that really the truth poverty gnaws on so many things things that were precious become meaningless you give up things you cant give up you grow suspicious and fearful and resigned  the bus would arrive at a familiar stop in a few hours when i left from that place a year ago i had left no message behind and now i was returning with no sign or warning i tried to recall my friends faces i had cut off contact with all of them what were they all doing these days would they be glad to see me would we be able to get together and laugh the way we had back then there was frost on the windows and i couldnt see the scenery outside on top of the frost i slowly moved my finger  i have to survive  hoseok 4 july year   i stood in the hallway the whole time she was receiving first aid even though it was night the hospital hallway was bustling with people moisture dripped from my hair wet with sweat and rain i dropped the bag i had taken off of her a variety of things tumbled out of it a few coins rolled away and a ball pen and a towel in the middle of it all was an airplane eticket i picked it up and scanned it  at that moment the doctor called me he said it was a mild concussion and nothing to worry about and after a moment she came out as well are you okay she said that her head just hurt a little and she took her bag from me then she spotted the eticket peeking out and looked up at my face i shifted my bag to my other shoulder and said that we should go pretending that it was nothing as we left the hospital it was raining as hard as ever we stood side by side outside the door  hoseokah she said it looked like she had something to say wait a second ill get an umbrella i ran off thoughtlessly into the rain there was a convenience store in the distance i knew that she had auditioned for an overseas dance team some time ago the plane ticket meant that she had made it i didnt want to hear her say it i didnt have the confidence to congratulate her  hoseok  july year 0  when i counted to three i heard the sound of laughter like a hallucination the next moment the young me passed by holding someones hand i looked back quickly but there was no one there except my classmates staring at me hoseokah the teacher called my name only then did i realize where i was it was a class field trip i was counting the fruits that were drawn in the textbook five six i kept counting but as i did my voice trembled and my hands grew sweaty the memory of that time kept surfacing  i couldnt clearly remember my mothers face that day i only remembered the chocolate bar she gave me as we looked around the amusement park hoseokah count to ten and then open your eyes when i had finished counting and opened my eyes my mother was gone i waited and waited but she never returned i had only counted to nine if i counted one more it would have been fine but my voice wouldnt come out my ears were ringing and my surroundings grew cloudy the teacher kept pointing telling me to keep counting my friends were staring at me i couldnt remember my mothers face it seemed like if i counted one more my mother would really never come back for me  just like that i collapsed to the ground  jimin 4 july year   by the time i returned to my senses i had washed my arm so much that i was losing skin my hands were trembling and i was short of breath my eyes were bloodshot what had just happened came back to me in fragments  for a moment i had lost focus i was dancing with a noona from the dance club a collaborative dance but i had lost my flow and we collided i fell to the rough floor and my arm started to bleed at that moment i had remembered what happened at the flowering arboretum i thought that i had overcome it but that wasnt the case i had to run away i had to wash it away i had to look away the me in the mirror was the same eightyearold kid who had run away in the rain then all at once i realized noona had fallen down too  there was nothing i could do all i could do was fall and hurt someone leave them behind and tremble at my own pain only to run after them too late with an umbrella before stopping every time i took a step rainwater soaked my sneakers car headlights passes me by it wasnt okay no it was okay it didnt hurt it wasnt that serious of an injury i was really okay  jimin 9 may year   in the end i had to go to the flowering arboretum i had quit telling myself the lie that i didnt remember what happened there i had to stop living in hiding in the hospital and stop having seizures if i wanted to do that i had to go to the place with that intent i went to the bus stop every day but i couldnt ride the bus to the arboretum  yoongi hyung came and sat next to me after id already let three buses go by i asked what was up and hyung said he was bored and had nothing to do then he asked why i was sitting here like this i thought about why i was sitting here like this it was because i had no courage i wanted to pretend i was okay now that i knew a little that i surpassed it on my own but in truth i was afraid i was afraid that i might encounter something that i might not withstand that i might have another seizure  yoongi hyung looked relaxed he slumped down like had not a thing in the world to worry him and said that the weather was nice said all kinds of useless things after i heard that i realized the weather really was nice i had been so worried that i didnt bother looking at my surroundings the sky was so blue a warm breeze blew on occasion from far off the shuttle bus for the arboretum was coming the bus stopped and the door opened the driver looked at me on impulse i spoke  hyung do you want to come with me  taehyung 7 july year   my side hurt so badly it seemed to be tearing sweat fell in drops in the nooks and crannies of the railroad in the vacant lot behind the convenience store under the overpass the girl was nowhere to be found i had even run to the bus stop but as expected i didnt see her the people waiting for their buses looked at me strangely what had happened we hadnt promised to meet but it was still strange that girl always appeared from somewhere and followed me around even if i told her it was annoying it was no use but now she was nowhere to be found even in the places we used to go together  i came to a familiar wall and slowed my steps there was graffiti there we had drawn together it was the first thing she had ever drawn on top of it there was a large x drawn it was her i hadnt seen her do it but i knew why there was no response instead several after images overlapped on the wall  her laughing at me after i had lain down on the railroad tracks and hit my head her helping me up after id fallen trying to help her run away her angry expression when we passed in front of a photo studio with a family photo in the window her gaze following the students we passed by unbeknownst even to her as we had sprayed this wall together i had said if you have a problem tell me about it dont just grumble to yourself the x was drawn over all of those memories it seemed like it was saying all of it was fake i had made my hands into fists why of course there was no response i kept walking we were alone again me and her  taehyung 0 march year 0  i slid down the hallway my feet making noisy sounds then i stopped i could see namjoon standing in front of our classroom our classroom nobody knew this but i called that place our classroom me and the hyungs and jungkook it was ours i caught my breath and approached i was going to startle them  principal i had barely taken five steps when i head an urgent voice through the open classroom window it seemed like seokjin hyung i stopped walking was seokjin hyung talking to the principal right now in our classroom why then i heard my name and yoongi hyungs and i saw namjoon hyung draw in a startled breath as if having sensed it seokjin hyung suddenly opened the door there was a phone in seokjin hyungs hand his shock and confusion was plain on his face i couldnt see namjoon hyungs expression i hid and watched seokjin hyung looked confused hyung must have had a reason after he spoke namjoon hyung passed by seokjin hyung and went into the classroom i couldnt believe it seokjin hyung told the principal what yoongi hyung and i had done for the last several days he told everything about skipping class and climbing over the wall and fighting with other kids but namjoon hyung said that was all okay  what are you doing here i turned around in shock it was hoseok hyung and jimin hoseok hyung pretended to be even more shocked then slung his arm over my shoulders in a moment of confusion i let hoseok hyung pull me into that classroom namjoon hyung and seokjin hyung were talking and they looked up seokjin hyung got up in a hurry and said something had come up he left the classroom i looked at namjoon hyungs expression he had watched seokjin hyungs retreating back but now he laughed as if nothing was wrong at that moment a thought occurred to me namjoon hyung must have had a reason because hyung knew more than me and was smarter and older and because this was our classroom i went into the classroom smiling the foolish smile that the others teasingly called my rectangle smile i thought that i wouldnt tell anyone else that i had overheard that conversation  jungkook 6 july year   i sneakily broke a flower off the hospitals wreath i kept laughing and having to bow my head to hide it the midsummer sunlight was blindingly bright i knocked on the hospital room door but there was no reply i knocked again no one was there it was only full of a very quiet darkness  i left the hospital room i had met her here when i was bored and stifled and pushing my wheelchair like crazy up and down the hallway she had appeared so suddenly that i barely had time to stop and there she stood a girl with her hair tied up in a ponytail when i left the hospital i saw a bench i remembered we had listened to music together and drawn sitting there i was still holding the wildflower in my hand there was no one to give it to  jungkook 0 september year 0  jeon jungkook youre not still going there are you i didnt answer i just stood there staring at the toes of my shoes when i didnt answer he hit me on the head with the attendance file but even so i didnt open my mouth it was the classroom i used with the hyungs after the day i had followed the hyungs around and we had discovered that classroom there wasnt a single day i hadnt gone maybe the hyungs didnt know sometimes they didnt come because they had other plans or were busy with parttime jobs i hadnt seen either seokjin hyung or yoongi hyung in a few days but not me i didnt skip a single day there were days when nobody came at all but that's okay even if it wasnt today then they would come tomorrow and if not tomorrow then the day after it was okay  you only learned bad things following them around he hit me again i lifted my gaze and looked at him he hit me again the image came to me of yoongi hyung hitting me i gritted my teeth and endured i didnt want to lie and say i hadnt been going  now i was standing again in front of that classroom it seemed like the hyungs would be there if i opened the door it seemed like they would look up from the fame they were playing and ask me why i was so late seokjin hyung and namjoon hyung would be reading books yoongi hyung would be playing the piano and hoseok hyung and jimin hyung would be dancing  but when i opened the door only hoseok hyung was there he was cleaning up the things we had left behind in the classroom i held the door handle and just stood there hyung came over and put his arm

BTS (방탄소년단),Love Yourself: 結 Answer Notes,seokjin 0 august  year  she seemed flustered as she stared at the diary she once believed she lost within every turned page were the movies she liked the places she wanted to go the flowers she preferred and the future she hoped for i had done this for her im sorry never came easy for me the diary acted as a starting and stopping spot for us i wanted to make her happy i wanted to make her laugh i wanted to be a good person i thought that following the words from the diary would help me do so but thats not how it worked the more i tried to be someone else the more frightened i became wouldnt my real self be discovered wouldnt she be disappointed and leave me desperately i hid and turned away from myself but just like how a person cant end a sentence without it being complete the me who i lost couldnt improve and instead wandered around the same places  i know now that the me that is incapable and makes mistakes and fails is still a part of myself no matter how terrible things become only by being true to myself can i continue to move forward i stood up and she didnt stop me  i left onto the street and took my hat off as i swept my hair back all the hours i spent trying to mold myself into someone else slipped through my fingers i lifted my head and looked at my reflection in the window staring back at me were pale lips a frail face thin shoulders i looked wretched i laughed my reflection laughed too  seokjin 5 june year 9  a lone flowerpot rested on the storage rooms window i didnt know where it came from which of my dongsaeng brought it i took out my phone the classroom was always dark with shadows since there wasnt any electricity but i could still distinguish green leaves from the pale light coming from the windows the photo i took on my phone didnt come out good and it wasnt because i simply took it with a phone i pondered this often  how a photo never captures what eyes can  i noticed an h written below the flowerpot when i approached when i lifted it up i read hoseoks flowerpot i laughed hoseok was the only dongsaeng whod bring a flowerpot here i placed it back on the windowsill so only the h is visible again i then looked around i didnt notice this before but the windowsill was covered with scattered writing the walls and ceiling were covered in it too pass or die the names of unrequited love dates and countless names that had become worn and illegible  this classroom hadnt always been a storage room students used to filter it every day itd be filled when school began and emptied during vacations were there students like us would they receive punishments for being late and missing class were there mercilessly violent teachers and never ending exams and coursework were there teachers whod tell principals about their students and their friends  i wondered whether my fathers name lied among the words the school was my fathers alma mater he was someone who believed attending the same schools maintained a familys dignity i read over the names and found my fathers it was in the middle of the left wall surrounded by other names a quote was written underneath it everything started here  seokjin  april year   it was april th again when my eyes opened sunlight shined through the open curtain i was overwhelmed with vertigo when i stood up i had to close my eyes when i did this my surroundings morphed into a red afterimage and i saw taehyung he was standing alone on top of the observation platform at the sea that happened on may nd it was the past and the future it was something thatd happened already and something that still had the chance to happen again it was then that i thought everything had finally been fixed i watched taehyung climb to the top of the platform as the sun began to set the sky was still blue but it was slowly blooming into red i saw taehyung climbing when i lifted my head he reached the top after a few moments and looked down at us then he jumped he leapt as if he had the wings of a bird and for a few seconds it seemed as if he froze in the air something overcame me the way a mirror breaks the way cold air blows in from an open window  when my eyes opened again it was today april th  yoongi 9 july year  what was the reason that that particular melody became stuck in my head only after i lost the person id practice it with i glanced at the piano across the room as i reclined on the couch when i was expelled i threw away the piano key that belonged to my mother  the only thing i'd salvaged from the ruins of my burned house the piano key half burned itself i threw it out of my apartments window i thought doing so would end it i repeated to myself like i had all those years ago that id never lay my hands on a piano again  early the next day i hurried down the stairs unable to wait for the elevator i thought id fallen asleep abruptly but the sun had risen already the things i did the night before suddenly flooded my thoughts the flowerbed outside the window was vacant when i asked the security guard he told me that the garbage truck had already came and thats how i lost my mothers piano key  i continued to give up on music after that countless times i wont do it i wont come back music is nothing but even when i ran away i knew i knew that id return to music the same why id stumbled down that staircase music was the kind of thing id never be able to let go of internally i was just as free as i was a person who was suffering i was confused but i was also lucid fear and confidence hope and despair  i lived between those contrasting emotions  suddenly i was overcome with the desire to play the piano i wanted to recognize the me who had pretended to be strong despite the reality that i was a fearful coward i wanted to pour the curses and make fractures and inflict wounds and hit and destroy and hold and cry but i didnt want to run away i wanted to finish the melody from the piano that frequented my mind every day for once it seemed like i could yoongi  april year   i kept walking with the acknowledgement that jungkook was following me containers continued to appear when i reached the train tracks it was the fourth container from the back hoseok mentioned having plans to meet namjoon and taehyung he told me to join them i said i would but i didnt really plan to attend i hated being attached to other people and hoseok knew that he probably didnt expect id stay true to my word  when i pulled the door open hoseok stared at me shocked when he saw jungkook behind me an exaggerated expression of mixed emotion drew across his face i pushed past both of them and strolled to the container how long has it been i could hear hoseok trying to pull jungkook who was shy in  namjoon and taehyung entered a side of taehyungs shirt was ripped when questioned about it namjoon pretended to hit taehyung with his knuckles this kids late because he got caught by some cops doing graffiti and i had to go pick him up taehyung made a melodramatic apologetic face and explained that his shirt had been ripped in the process of running away i sat in the corner and watched them namjoon gave taehyung a new shirt to change into and hoseok pulled out hamburgers and beverages in the midst of everything jungkook stood awkwardly he stood as if he hadnt any idea what to do  in retrospect its exactly how he acted in high school hoseok would noisily move around while jungkook hovered around him unsure of what to do  how long had it been since we met like this i couldnt remember what happened to seokjin hyung and jimin an uncharacteristic thought crossed my mind this was the place id visited for the first time while my heart was lost somewhere else  yoongi  may year  the sheet was immediately engulfed in flames the pile of objects lost their identities among the intense heat i couldn't smell the rotting mold nor feel the overbearing humidity nor see the dark light the only thing left was pain  the pain of the flames the pain of my fingers blistering it was only among the fire that my fathers emotionless expression and the sound of music relented  i was very different from my father he didnt understand me and i didnt understand him could i have changed his mind if i tried probably not all i could do for him was run and hide and defy it occasionally occurred to me that it wasnt my father that i was escaping but if it wasnt him what was it fear settled in for a moment what was i running from what ends did i have to go to to be free it all felt impossible it felt like i could hear someone calling but i didnt look away from the dancing flames i couldnt breathe i dont know if it was the smoke or the pain i didnt have the power to move anymore despite this i knew it was jungkooks voice that was calling he mustve been upset and angry maybe hed feel bad for me i just wanted to disappear i wanted the smoke and heat just everything to end jungkook shouted something again but i couldnt hear it my gaze fell when i looked up again i saw the sight of a dirty room in a dirtier world during what i thought would be my last moments i saw red flames endless smoke and jungkooks panicked face namjoon 0 july year   i lifted my head from scanning the magazine advertisements a different face had been occupying the window seat of the library across from me for the past few days the heavy book large bag and paper cup were the same but it wasnt her i looked back down at the magazine i was reading the same page over and over again for an hour my eyes werent processing the words at all why was i still here i couldnt fabricate an answer among people who were absorbed in their own worlds i was carelessly reading the same page of a magazine i felt impatient as if something was supposed to start but i knew nothing would happen i brought the magazine back and strolled between bookshelves they were taller than i was filled to the brim with books an open window breeze carried the librarys scent in the air i reminisced my highschool years the books i read in the company of my friends in that storage room had the same scent had the present me grown from the old me at all i couldnt bring myself to be positive it couldve been because everything seemed to be frozen back then i moved to a different bookshelf and picked an old book i studied from high school i had to start over i had to give everything up one at a time  namjoon 8 april year   i knew something was going on with taehyung for a long time although he pretended that nothing was wrong his momentary anxieties gave it away the fact that he didnt know how to handle it made it all the more obvious to me he was in and out of the police station he had wounds all over his body he had nightmares i never pressed on the issue because i was waiting for taehyung to bring it up himself the reason i never confronted him was also because i doubted my own to right to hear about it i wanted to be a hyung an adult but in the end it all comes to the simple fact that i couldnt help my friends when they were struggling they praised me for being all grown up but i wasnt really an adult faced with problems i could only hesitate and ignore the reality before me  yoongi hyung died  taehyung had that nightmare again today i had to shake him from his sleep he sat in silence for a long time staring into space he didnt wipe his tears and he mumbled incoherent things he mumbled about yoongi dying and jungkook getting in an accident and me being caught up in a fight he said that he dreamed of those types of things everyday  that the traumas were so clear that they seemed real hyung dont go anywhere  namjoon  april year  i finished pumping gas i begun returning to the shop something brushed against my face and fell stepping back a crumbled bill settled at my feet out of reflex i reached down the random people in the car laughed and i stopped reaching down seokjin hyung watched me from a distance i couldnt raise my head what are you supposed to do when you make eye contact with people who drive expensive cars and ridicule others you confront them if you believe theyre doing something unjust then you have to confront them its not a matter of pride or bravery or equality its something that you just have to do  but i was a parttime worker at a gas station if a customer threw trash i had to clean it up if they cussed me out i had to listen if they threw a bill at my feet i had to pick it up my body shook with humiliation i dug my fingernails into my palm  at that moment someones hand reached down and picked up the bill the car filled with people left as if the fun was over i couldnt look up even after they were gone i didnt have the courage to look seokjin hyung in the eyes it wasn't like he didnt know about my cowardliness my poverty my situation but i still didnt want him to witness it hyung stood at the end of my gaze he didnt move he didnt approach he didnt speak hoseok  august year   jimin and she stood in the middle of the practice studio the starting pose seemed endless when the music flowed from the speaker they begun the choreography i practiced with her not that long ago i watched from my place on the floor  when i first discovered that my ankle momentary prevented me from dancing itd been hard to swallow it was stifling to simply watch others dance but overtime as i taught and helped jimin improve i realized that not being able to dance wasnt that big of a deal i could continue to be happy other ways  i couldnt let even the smallest of mistake go overlooked when i helped jimin when he made a movement smaller or more subdued id stop him and examine each movement individually but when i returned to my place on the floor almost like an audience for jimin i realized that jimins dancing was bigger that just the step to step movements i viewed what i originally recognized as mistakes differently the trivial mistakes and imperfections contributed  to something greater something unique it was different than my own dancing but jimin had his own timing and his own expression his dancing was bight and heartwarming on its own  when the music ended jimins dance did too his face glowed with excitement and happiness she stood next to him shed be going overseas soon we locked eyes she didnt look like my mother at all because i couldnt remember my mothers face so why did i see my mother in her my heart began to ache and the pain in my ankle intensified hoseok  march year   i liked being around people when i was still at the orphanage i worked at a fast food chain and was exposed to a lot of people id always laugh and be cheerful i liked that job with my experience of being exposed to more bad than good it was evident that i had few reasons to laugh and be cheerful perhaps thats why i enjoyed the job so much it gave me the opportunity to laugh and smile and be happy what does it matter if it was usually forced overtime i could trick myself into believing that it was all real my mood became better when i let myself laugh and by treating people kindly i became a kinder person there were hard days like always and sometimes taking a step forward would be too overwhelming but even so it was easier back then to withstand the hard days because i had friends things arent the same now  sometimes i remembered my friends when i looked at the store of customers seokjin hyung who transferred in namjoon who disappeared one day yoongi who wouldnt answer calls anymore taehyung whose whereabouts we werent sure of and jimin who never returned after he went to the emergency room id seen jungkook in his school uniform through the window a few times but he never frequented the store anymore perhaps those times had passed  i heard the sound of a customer entering with a cheerful smile i greeted them  hoseok  may year   i opened the emergency exit door and rushed down the staircase my heart felt like it was going to explode i swore i glimpsed the clear face of my mother in the hospital hallway when i looked back people from the opened elevator doors distorted my vision i pushed through the people and followed where id seen my mother leaving through the emergency exit without rest and with an anxious heart i ran down the stairs two at a time  mom my mother ceased her walking she turned around i ran down another flight her face became visible it was then that i lost my balance and my center of gravity fell forward i closed my eyes but a persons hand reached out and held onto my arm when i looked back at my savior jimin stared at me with a shocked expression before i could thank him i turned my head  there was a woman with a surprised face a young boy stood next to her with wide unblinking eyes the woman wasnt my mother i remained at the top of the staircase staring at her blankly  i didnt remember how i got out of that situation i didnt ask how jimin had managed to catch my fall either my mind couldnt focus on such trivial details the woman wasnt my mother and somewhere deep down i knew that from the start its been more than 0 years since she left me alone in that theme park shed be older now if i met her i wouldnt recognize her by now i could barely even remember how she looked all those years ago when i glanced behind me jimin was following me quietly back in highschool jimin told me that he had stayed in the hospital after being in the emergency room i thought about how he looked at me unsure of how to respond to the inquiry of whether he wanted to leave the hospital was jimin trapped the same way i was incapable of both holding on and letting go of old memories i took a step toward him  jiminah lets get out of here  jimin 8 july year   i was stuck in the practice studio again it was late and the train stopped running to be honest i had waited for it to stop so i could practice alone and obsess over my imperfections i was restless i was scared but it was something i wanted to do and so i stayed in that room overnight overtime my fear in my heart began to evaporate only the fun air of dancing persisted for the longest time i believed that the weak small powerfless me i imagined was real when i danced i could only think of my own weight or the length of my body or my speed or my strength however the me who danced wasnt small nor weak my stuttering movements became more fluid and i improved i grew the way fingernails do slowly i realized that i was actually an expressive person i felt this way when i danced like i was saying everything i couldnt when i started to dance i for the first time started to like myself  jimin 6 may year   hoseok hyung lived in a rooftop apartment at the end of a narrow alley it was very high when i visited the one room apartment hed brag about how it was the highest room in the city he bragged that he could see everything every place from his rooftop room from the window we could see the trains and the train tracks and the containers namjoon hyung lived in one of those if i moved my gaze down a little i could see the school we all used to attend after locating the school i drew my gaze to the opposite side of the city a line of apartments rested at the bottom of the mountain there was my  no  my parents house they were looking for me when i ran away from the hospital without a word they were contacted i didnt have the confidence to face them i couldnt go home yet that didnt mean i wanted to return to the hospital but i had nowhere to go and no money hyung had told me to follow him and he lead me here  hyungs house  i looked back to the apartment buildings i had to return eventually i had to tell my parents i wasnt going back to the hospital i inhaled sharply and then slowly exhaled it felt like the mere thought could trigger another seizure i didnt trust myself anywhere other than at the hospital i could be rushed there again i was so afraid i couldnt stand it  jimin 5 may year   hoseok hyung stood next to me when i opened my eyes an all too familiar ceiling looked down at me with a familiar darkness i tried to sit up but he put his finger up to his lips everyone was sleeping the room was quiet hyung offered me a new shirt and jerked his head toward the exit of the hospital  we all came together  he said that namjoon hyung was keeping guard while yoongi hyung was buying time talking with the nurses jungkook and taehyung would meet us at the elevator hyung reached out a hand when he saw my confused expression i was still in a daze  id dreamed of the day id leave the hospital sometimes i wanted to leave and see my friends so i could spend time with them and laugh and talk the way we did before but now i didnt know was it actually a good idea to leave my parents hid me here and buried my existence people whispered that i had a mental illness i didnt know if hoseok hyung viewed me the same way maybe he thought i was strange maybe i made him uncomfortable  come on were running out of time the clocks second hand sound seemed unconventionally fast because of hyungs words the sound of footsteps like an auditory hallucination came closer to the hospital room hyung and i looked toward the door and then at each other he never let his hand leave me taehyung  august year   when i turned around i discovered small letters written below the x that spelled out short sentences one said it isnt my fault it was her i hadnt seen her myself and i didnt know her handwriting but i knew it seemed like a last goodbye saying that it wasnt my fault she left saying that this didnt happen because i was a bad person saying that i shouldnt blame or torment myself saying that i should be brave  when i came to my senses i was back at my house i could hear noonas scream from behind the door i flung it open and a familiar scene was laid out i moved to block noona from my father and i grabbed him i looked him in the eyes and at first he seemed surprised but then he swung it knocked me out for a second this wasnt the first time that sort of thing happened noonas crying grew louder my chin ached and the smell of rust stained my mouth but i didnt stop i grabbed my father by his waist and he angrily yelled he beat my shoulders and back relentlessly i only held on tighter  it wasnt that i didnt feel the pain it wasnt that i wasnt scared it was the understanding that if i let go this same daily cycle of pain and suffering would repeat i wanted things to change  no im not like my father im going to protect our family something he couldnt do taehyung  may year   hyung is that all you arent hiding anything else from us our surroundings became quiet simultaneously everyones eyes were on me i looked at seokjin hyung he looked back at me his eyes were full of exhaustion and pity somebody grabbed my arm and stopped me before i could press the issue again i didnt have to look to know it was namjoon hyung  what does it have to do with you you arent my real brother i could feel namjoons stare i shook off his hand without lifting my head i knew that i was angry at him for no reason i repeated the words i heard hyung use on the phone  that i was angry that i was upset his words werent incorrect i was a year younger than him i wasnt his brother it was true that i should take care of myself but i was still upset i was angrier than i could put into words i hoped hed understand  taehyungah im sorry lets stop talking about this it was seokjin hyung who said this it was seokjin hyung who called my name it was seokjin hyung who apologized namjoon hyung didnt do anything what do you mean stop since its come up why dont we talk about everything you have something else youre hiding  lets talk outside namjoon hyung replied holding onto my arm again he dragged me out before i could shake him off let me go what right do you have to stop me what do you know hyung you dont know anything you just think hes this great guy right he let go of my arm after that i stumbled at the release no it wasnt just him letting me go that made me stumble when he released my arm it felt as if everything that had sustained me for so long crumbled perhaps i hoped hed never let go that hed get angry and drag me out the way he did perhaps i hoped hed scold me like a real brother like someone close and precious but hyung let go of my arm and i could only laugh whats so special about being together what are we to each other were all alone in the end that was the moment seokjin hyung hit me  taehyung 9 march year  the gas station worker spat on the ground when he left and i sprawled my body on the ground again id been caught spraying graffiti on the wall of the gas station and the owner hit me while asking what i thought i was doing drawing on someones wall i rolled on the ground getting beaten was something i was used to  i started graffiti a long time ago when i found a discarded spray can someone left behind i think it was yellow i sprayed it around and stared at the paint it was a bright yellow against the grey wall for a while i mindlessly painted like that and i only stopped when i ran out of paint i threw it away and stepped back to examine my work i felt out of breath at the sight i didnt know what it meant i didnt know what the designs and colors stood for or what id done or why i did it but i did it and so i concluded that it was an expression of my feelings stained on the wall id spewed my heart out and at first i thought the drawing was ugly for a moment i wanted to erase it from the wall however instead of erasing it i caked on other colors and other shapes and other designs i sat against it when i was done it didnt matter whether i liked it or not it didnt matter whether it was beautiful or not it was me  i coughed when i rose to my feet when i hunched over and spat out blood i saw someones hand reach down to pick up the spray can it was namjoon hyung i chuckled i thought he was some sort of ghost he reached out his hand and i simply looked back up at him hyung took my hand and helped me stand up properly his hand was warm jungkook 6 july year  when i looked back the hospital was a faraway place i couldnt see the bench i left those wildflowers nor the window i looked out with her anymore she was a space that let me breathe in the stuffy atmosphere of the hospital wed sit on that bench and talk about everything until the sun would set i talked about playing in the hideout and vacations i took to the beach and walking to the train station she told me about the corners of the hospital and which window you could watch the river from and the which staircase secretly led to the roof there wasnt anything she didnt know about that hospital her room was empty because she was discharged or did she move to a different hospital i asked the nurses but they said it was confidential a corner of my soul felt empty when i turned around and started walking i could see the school it seemed that everything i ever told her about myself had something to do with the hyungs every story i told incorporated them in some way for the lonelier part of me the hyungs had become my friends family and teachers my story was intertwined with theirs and i only existed within them at some point it occured to me there may come a time after my time spent with them one day i may go looking only to discover that theyd be gone or maybe something else could happen i didnt know  i thought about that night when the moon ascended in the sky the world turned upside down the headlamps inverted on themselves the car passed me and then disappeared the sound of the engine it was familiar for some reason i didnt want to jump to conclusions but i still kept thinking about that moment jungkook 8 may year 9  hyungs what do you dream about the hyungs looked back at me in response to my question i have to write a paper about future hopes i elaborated seokjin hyung opened his mouth and said i dont think i have a dream if i have something i hope for its just to the extent of wanting to become a good person he cut himself off seeming embarrassed then yoongi hyung who was at the piano spoke in an airy voice its okay to not have a dream i dont have one im just going to become whatever everyone burst out at his words they fit him well  im going to become a superhero and save the world from bad guys taehyung said this while standing on his chair to pose he reached his arms toward the sky hoseok hyung scolded him telling him to get down before he got hurt hoseok hyung then added i want to find my mom and live happily being happy is my dream hyung smiled as he spoke does that mean youre unhappy now jimin asked hoseok hyung replied when i was in preschool i wanted to be president but i didnt have anything i wanted to be after that  only namjoon hyung was left after that after feeling everyones eyes on him he shrugged i want to say something nice but i dont really have a dream either i just wish my parttime job paid more i nodded and stared down at the paper in front of me the paper was divided into spaces for students and spaces for parents what did i want to become i couldnt think of anything to write  jungkook  april year  i walked down the rooftop railing of an abandoned building when i lifted my leg my foot was shadowed by the darkness bubbling below the night of the city was spread out underneath my feet neon signs honking horns and dust was scattered around in the dark for a moment i felt dizzy from vertigo i stretched my arms out to balance myself then i thought about it it would only take one wrong step itd only take one step to end everything i leaned toward the darkness and it spread from my foot and up my leg my breathing stopped when i leaned further my mind was void of any thoughts nothing no one i didnt want to leave anything behind but i couldnt remember anything this was the end  it was then that my phone began to ring clarity washed over me as if id awoken from a dream my subdued senses returned and i pulled out my phone it was yoongi hyung,anger

BTS (방탄소년단),Love Yourself: 承 Her Notes,seokjin  march year 9  i followed my father into the principal's office it had a damp smell it had been 0 days since i returned from america i heard that i had to start a year lower because the education system was different i am leaving him in your hands my father said when he put his hands on my shoulders i flinched without knowing  school in general is a dangerous place we need order and control the principal said this while staring dead into my eyes every time he spoke the fat around his wrinkly cheeks and mouth would shake the inside of his lips were dark red don't you think so as well i was hesitating at the abrupt question and my father squeezed my shoulders harder the sensation caused shocks to go up and down the muscles of my neck i trust that you'll do well the principal persistently continued to make eye contact and my father squeezed me tighter he clenched his fists around my shoulders to the point that my bones felt like they would shatter my body was shaking and dripping with cold sweat you have to tell me right now are you going to be a good student the principal asked me this with a straight face  yes i squeezed out a response and the pain disappeared i heard the laughter of my father and the principal i couldn't raise my head i could only see the brown shoes of my father and black shoes of the principal i didn't know where the light was coming from but it twinkled i was scared of the light  seokjin  april year   i went to the sea alone through the camera lens the sea stretched far and wide it was so blue the light reflecting off the water and the wind in the trees were familiar sights if you asked me if anything had changed i would've answered by saying that it was me who changed as a person pressing the camera button the scenery in front of my eyes changed to the day from  years and 0 months ago it disappeared just as quickly that day we had sat by the beach shouldertoshoulder we were exhausted we had nothing and had no idea of what the future held the only thing we knew was that we were at least together   seokjin 5 august year   i stepped on the brakes after realizing i had unknowingly increased my speed while driving away from the intersection the cars behind me honked in annoyance and passed me it sounded like somebody cursed at me but i couldn't hear due to the city noise i saw a small flower shop in the right alley corner i didn't make a sudden stop because i'd seen the flower shop but rather it felt like i'd seen the flower shop after making a sudden stop  the store was under construction and i didn't have high expectations when i approached the owner tidying up in corner of the flower shop i'd already visited a couple of flower shops but none of those florists knew of the existence of this flower they showed me flowers that looked similar in color but i wasn't looking for something similar the flower had to be the real one the shop owner stared at my face after hearing the name of the flower the owner then said the flower shop had not officially opened yet but said they could deliver they asked me why i needed that specific flower  as i steered the wheel and entered the road again i pondered the inquiry the reason why i needed this specific flower i had only one reason was because i wanted to make them happy i wanted to see them happy i wanted to be a good person  yoongi 5 june year 0  i opened the door with a loud slam and took out the envelope from inside the last drawer of my desk as i turned the envelope around a piano key fell to the floor with a sound i threw the half burned piano key in the trash can and laid down on my bed the emotions that were brought up hadn't simmered down yet my breathing was a mess my fingers suddenly covered with singe  after the funeral ended there was a time when i returned to that house of ash left behind from the fire when i entered my mother's room the piano that was burnt to the point of nonrecognition caught my eye i sank to the floor i sat there as the sunlight shone through the window in the midst of the last glimmers of sunlight a few keys rolled around what kind of sound would i hear from the keys if i pressed on them i thought about how many times my mother's fingers had touched them from the pile of piano keys i put one of them in my pocket and left the room  it had been four years since then and the house was always quiet the silence made people go crazy after dad went to sleep at 0 pm everything became increasingly more quiet it became suffocating this was how everything functioned i was tired because i had to live in such silence i was tired because i had to follow a predetermined timetable it wasn't simple to follow such a form but what was significantly harder was living in that house taking pocket money from dad eating dinner with him listening to his scoldings whenever i had an argument with him i always considered abandoning him and running away from home to live by myself i never had the courage to actually do so  i got up from bed and picked up the piano key from the dustbin under my study desk i opened the window and the night breeze came in the things that happened felt like a night breeze slapping me in the face i used all of my strength to throw the piano key into the cold air it had been 0 days since i last went to school even if i didn't want to i assumed that i'd be kicked out i didn't know if it was because of my deteriorated hearing but i didn't hear the sound of the piano key dropping to the ground no matter how hard i tried to imagine it i didn't know what that piano key dropping to the ground sounded like no matter how much time passed that piano would not make a sound again i told myself i would never play the piano again  yoongi 7 april year   i stopped walking at the clumsy sound of a piano the only sound in the empty construction site was the popping of a fire someone had lit in an oil drum i knew the sound of the song that was playing but why my drunken footsteps stumbled i closed my eyes and walked carelessly as the heat of the fire grew the piano sound the night air and my intoxication all grew fainter  i opened my eyes at the sudden sound of a horn as a car grazed narrowly past me in the confusion of the headlight's brightness the wind of the car's passing and my own drunkenness i stumbled helplessly i heard the driver curse at me as i came to a stop prepared to curse right back i suddenly realized i could no longer hear the sound of the piano amidst the sound of the blazing fire the wind and the silence left in the wake of the car the piano sound was gone it seemed to have stopped why had it stopped who was playing it  the sparks from the fire surged forth from the drum barrel with a sharp noise i looked at it for a long moment spaced out my face became hot with its warmth it was at that moment i heard the clanging sound of a fist slamming down onto piano keys on instinct i looked behind me for a moment my blood rushed so rapidly that my breathing became erratic the nightmares from when i was young it was like a sound i'd heard there  suddenly i was running against my own will i ran towards the music store my body turned of its own volition to look behind i felt somehow like that was something i had repeated countless times before it was a sensation of having forgotten something important  the music store had a broken window someone was sitting in front of the piano although many years had passed i recognized them in an instant the person was crying their hands curled into fists i didn't want to be involved with someone else's life i didn't want to comfort anyone else's loneliness i didn't want to become a person who meant something to anyone i had no confidence that i could protect them i didn't have the confidence to be at their side until the end i didn't want to hurt them i didn't want to be hurt  i walked slowly i wanted to turn back and leave but i approached them without realizing a wrong note rang out of the piano jungkook lifted his head and looked at me hyung  it was our first time seeing each other since i quit high school  yoongi 8 june year   i put on a new tshirt the me that i saw in the mirror didn't look like me i was wearing a tshirt that said dream on it and in all aspects that just wasn't my style i didn't like that it was red the word dream or the way it fit tightly against my body i took out a cigarette in annoyance and looked for my lighter it wasn't in the pocket of my jeans i looked in my back pocket and realized that they took it without care they took it out of my hands and threw a lollipop and this tshirt at me  i ruffled my hair and stood up from my spot i heard the sound of a message notification when i saw the three letters on my phone screen all of my surroundings around me became brighter and my heart dropped with a koong i broke the cigarette in half as i checked the message the me in the mirror was smiling i didn't know what was so great but the me wearing a tight red colored tshirt that had the word dream on it was smiling like a fool too  hoseok 5 september year 0  jimin's mother paced back and forth in the emergency room after checking that the name on the head of the bed and the iv drop were properly placed she brushed a strand of grass from jimin's shoulder with one finger i approached hesitantly feeling that i should tell her why jimin was in the emergency room i wondered whether or not to tell her about the seizure at the bus stop jimin's mother seemed to discover my presence and she looked at me with a long evaluating gaze i didn't know what to do so i stood still jimin's mother only said thank you and then turned back to him  the next time jimin's mother looked at me the doctor and nurses had started to move the bed i moved to follow jimin's mother said thank you again and pushed at my shoulder rather than pushing it would be more correct to say that she touched me slightly and then pulled her hand away however i suddenly felt an invisible line being drawn between jimin's mother and myself the line was sure and solid it was cold and sturdy it was a line that i could never surmount i had lived at the orphanage for 0 years i suddenly knew that something was wrong with my whole body my sight the air in a moment of bewilderment i took a step back and fell to the floor jimin's mother looked vacantly down at me although she was a small beautiful person her shadow was large and cold that shadow fell over me as i collapsed on the emergency room floor when i lifted my head jimin's bed had left the emergency room and could no longer be seen after that day jimin didn't come back to school  hoseok 5 february year   i danced not being able to take my eyes off of myself through the mirror everything became peaceful moving my body along with the music everything apart from my feelings was quiet  the first time i danced i was  years old i think it was for a talent show or retreat i went to i stood on stage with all of my friends the thing i remember the most from that day was the applause and the feeling of actually feeling like myself for the first time of course back then i thought it was simply thrilling to move my body with the music it was bliss and i found out later on that that bliss wasn't coming from the applause but from within  i was tied to a lot of things outside of the mirror i couldn't stand having my feet touch the ground even if it was for a few seconds even if i hated it i smiled even when i was sad i smiled i took pills that i didn't need and fainted no matter the location that's why when i danced i tried not to look away from my reflection in the mirror it was a time when i could be myself fly and drop all of the heavy burdens it was a time when i gained hope that i could become happy i wast at peace with the idea of looking at myself during those times  hoseok  may year   i looked away and felt my breathing stop all of a sudden although my breathing had been shaky due to dancing for a long time it wasn't the same feeling i thought about how i was like my mother no it wasn't a thought it wasn't a form of recognition it wasn't something i could explain i couldn't even look at my friend who i've known for over 0 years now we learned how to dance together failed together and even gained strength together because of how much we were sweating there were times we laid down and threw towels at each other playing around this feeling felt like something i had never been able to feel i stood up from my spot i leaned against the wall i tried to calm down my breathing but i heard where are you going hoseok from somewhere a voice it could have been any voice the voice called out hoseok it could've been any voice yet it made me think about a 7 year old me from a time i couldn't even remember  namjoon 5 may year 0  i went to the warehouse classroom that we claimed as our secret base we always went there i picked up a few chairs and i made my way in i set the toppledover table upright and patted off the dust on top of it with my palm to humans separation is always sentimental today was the last day of school and also two weeks until we'd move away i didn't know if i would ever come back here or whether i would be able to see my hyungs and dongsaengs again i folded the paper in half and placed it on the table although i held a pen in my hand i didn't know what to write time passed by after writing some meaningless words the pencil lead broke with a sound  you must survive  i unconsciously doodled those words onto the paper among all dark lead powder and doodling i was suddenly reminded of poverty parents dongsaengs moving and other messy things  i folded the paper into a ball put it into my pocket and got up from my seat dust was everywhere again when i put the table back as i got ready to leave i fogged up the window with my breath and wrote 4 words it was not enough at the moment but it could be conveyed to everyone even if unsaid we will meet again i hoped that this could be a promise between us  namjoon  april year   i was digging through a shirt sale that didn't cost much when taehyung reached from behind and took a shirt it had the same phrases printed on it as my shirt taehyung smiled at me and took his ripped shirt off hoseok looked at me with shocked eyes taehyung wore my tshirt and looked at himself through my dirty mirror he laughed  i was late because he wanted to do graffiti and got caught by the police i had to pull him out i pretended that i was getting angry at taehyung and taehyung acted like he was really sorry yoongi who was sitting in the corner of my trailer walked towards us and hit taehyung on the shoulder  namjoon 0 june year   i looked a little strangely at myself in the mirror as if my hand had its own control i pressed the open door button there were moments like this moments that felt like i had repeated countless times even though it was obviously the first time the elevator door that was closing opened again and a bunch of people pushed in a person that had their hair tied in a yellow rubber band caught my eye i didn't press the open button knowing that the person would be there but i thought that it was obvious that the person should be there i moved back one step at a time as my back hit the cold wall i raised my head the yellow rubber band caught my eye  a person's back told a lot of stories but i only understood a few of them some i had been able to faintly guess and some i couldn't understand i suddenly came to the realization that you could only really know a person when reading everything just from their back were there people who could read who i was just by looking at my back i raised my head and made eye contact with them through the mirror they looked away there were many moments like this i raised my head again but all i could see was my own face i couldn't see my back  jimin 0 august year 9  while hoseok hyung was answering a call i played around by stepping on hyung's shadow hoseok hyung bursted into laughter and said jimin has grown up it took  hours to walk home from school if you took the bus it was less than 0 minutes it would be too little if you said it took 0 minutes hyung always lead me through shortcuts alleys or even old s we would stubbornly walk this route it had been a year since i was discharged from the hospital and transferred schools school was far from home and i didn't know anybody i thought it was fine i had transferred schools many times and who knew when i would be admitted to the hospital again i thought that this would be nothing much  at that time i met hoseok hyung it was just after the start of the new semester hyung approached me and stayed with me for  hours i only found out a long time later that our homes weren't even in the same direction i didn't ask why he stayed with me i was hoping in my heart that the  hours under the sun could be lengthened  after teasing hyung during his call and stepping on his shadow i ran away hyung hung up the call and chased after me under the heat of the sun my ice cream melted i heard the song of the cicadas i found that i was suddenly scared how long would these days last  jimin 8 september year 0  i stopped counting a few days after i was hospitalized counting was something you'd do when you wanted to get out counting was something you'd do when you thought there was hope of getting out the trees and leaves far off outside of the window still looked like a colorful painting due to this observation i knew not that much time had passed at most a little more than a month could have passed the medicine made everything boring and dull even so today was a special day the kind of day you'd have to write about in a diary but i didn't have a diary i didn't want to have any problems to write about anyway today i lied for the first time i looked into the doctor's eyes and pretended to be gloomy i don't remember a thing  jimin  july year   in the end i sprawled out on the floor i turned off the music and all at once my surroundings were quiet i heard nothing except the sound of my breathing and my own beating heart i pulled out my phone and played the choreography video i learned previously that morning in the video hyung's movements were smooth and accurate that was the result of countless hours and sweat it was the result of practice since i was nowhere near that i was incredibly jealous understanding and hoping were different i was discontented often i suddenly stood up again i imitated the turn as he'd done it but my steps kept getting tangled i kept making mistakes at the part where we had to match our flow when moving positions we had decided to try again tomorrow but until then i wanted to show that i was serious rather than the playful praise of that was better than i expected i wanted to be recognized as a serious and equal partner one who could match breaths with hyung  taehyung 9 december year 0  i entered the living room after taking off my shoes and dropping my bag dad was inside i didn't think of how long it had been since i last saw him or where he had been i just ran into his embrace i couldn't recall clearly what happened afterwards did i first smell the alcohol did i hear him curse at me or was i slapped by him i didn't know what actually happened he reeked of alcohol his breathing was rough and he had foul breath his eyes were bloodshot and his beard was unkempt then he used his fist to hit me asked me what i was looking at and hit me again he lifted me high into the air although his bloodshot eyes were scary i couldn't bring myself to cry i was too scared that was not my dad no he was but he didn't feel like it i kicked my legs in the air suddenly my head hit the wall and i fell to the floor i felt like my head was going to explode my sight became blurry and gradually darkened for awhile all i could hear in my mind was my dad's breathing  taehyung  may year   i passed by the area of trees again where i received hyung's call recently that thing had continued to happen i moved to a place where no one could hear me i purposely slowed down my pace and hid myself near the sea hyung didn't see me and simply passed by aren't you just one year older than me whatever it's not something you have to be responsible for anyway i'll take care of it  there was something cold that climbed up my back only to disappear everything in my world seemed to have collapsed it was as if i was struggling in the deep sea making others feel cold and scared tragic and lonely i was angry i felt that i couldn't tolerate it anymore i wanted to stop everything i wanted to hit him but that smaller part of me was still scared my dad's blood inherently flew in my veins as well his dna was my dna was there violence in me too there was something that wanted to burst out of my tightly wound body  taehyung 5 june year   i purposely slowed my footsteps and perked my ears up at the sound that someone walking behind me today was the third time we had met at the convenience store if there was something that was different it was that today they had run away as soon as they saw me then they hung around in a small vacant lot behind the store as soon as i appeared they hid again they hid themselves well but their shadow was reaching far towards the front of the abandoned lot i laughed i passed by pretending not to see they started to follow me  i entered a narrow alley this was the only place in our neighborhood where the streetlamps weren't broken the alley was long and the streetlamp was located somewhere in the middle when the source of light was ahead my shadow stretched behind my shadow probably stretch all the way to the feet of the person who was following me with bated breath as i passed beneath the streetlamp my shadow disappeared beneath my feet i started walking a little faster not long after a shadow that wasn't mine appeared on the cement road i stopped my steps the presence behind me stopped too the two shadows of different heights stopped side by side  i spoke i'm going to wait until you come here the shadow jumped it held still as if saying it wasn't there i can see everything  i pointed out the shadow the sound of footsteps started to grow closer purposefully noisy i laughed  jungkook 5 june year 0  i gently touched the piano keys with my fingertip it left my finger smudged with dust even when using the slightest pressure of my finger to press down on the keys the piano still let out a sound different from the ones hyung would play hyung hadn't been to school for ten days today i heard that he'd been expelled namjoon hyung and hoseok hyung didn't say anything i didn't say anything because i was scared to hear the answer two weeks ago before the teacher had revealed our secret location there was only me and hyung here there was an open inspection that day i didn't want to remain in class so i ran to that place hyung didn't look back just played the piano as i laid on two joint desks to take a nap in theory hyung and the piano exist as two separate entities but it was hard to view them apart i didn't know why but hearing hyung's playing made me want to cry  when it felt as if the tears would soon fall i hastily turned onto my back just then the door opened with an explosive bang the piano music stopped i was slapped so hard i fell to the ground i huddled on the floor listening to the barrage of angry words thrown at me eventually the sound stopped i turned and saw that hyung had pushed the teacher back he sheltered me with his whole body past hyung's shoulders i could see the angry expression on the teacher's face  i pressed the piano keys again trying to play a tune hyung used to play had hyung really been expelled will i ever see him again hyung said before that getting a beating was routine for him if it wasn't for me hyung wouldn't have hit the teacher if it wasn't for me hyung would still be here playing the piano  jungkook  april year   i finally fulfilled my wish when i saw the delinquents on the street i purposely bumped into them and got beaten up i couldn't help but laugh as they beat me my laughter lead them to call me crazy and hit me harder i leaned against the shutters and looked at the dark sky it was late at night there was nothing to see in the sky i saw grass that reminded me of how i felt easily blown over by the wind i felt the tears coming and purposefully made myself cry  when i closed my eyes i saw an image of my stepfather clearing his throat my stepbrother continuously kicking me while laughing my stepfather's relatives would look elsewhere or talk about meaningless things it was as if i didn't exist as if i was nothing in front of them my mother stood helplessly i started coughing from the dust my chest hurt as if someone had taken a knife to it i climbed up the roof of the construction site the dark colors of the night seemed to overshadow the city i walked on top of the railing holding out both of my hands for balance in that moment i nearly stumbled and fell the brief moment reminded me that i could easily die if i just took one more step would death bring the end of anything no one would be sad if i wasn't around  jungkook 6 july year   i stood by the window with my headphones on humming softly to the song it had been a week i didn't have to look at the lyrics to sing along to the song anymore i took the headphones off one ear to listen to my soft voice although i liked the beautiful lyrics they still made me shy i scratched my head the huge window let in the bright sunlight of july the trees swayed gently in the wind every time the light shined on my face it felt different i closed my eyes closing my eyes filtered out the light i started singing again i didn't know if it was because of the lyrics or the song or what but it felt as if my heart had been painfully broken,sadness
